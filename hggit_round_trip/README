The question is if there are "round trip" issues when the commit from
git->hg comes back to the git repo via a different route.

For example:

  RoR (hg) ----------------> github_read_only (git)
       ^                            |
       |                            v
       |                      fork_on_github
       |                            |
       |                            v
       +--------------------< clone_to_pc
                              (with hg commit support)
                                    ^
                                    |
                              local commits

If the 2 separate converters do not do the same thing, the commit will
cause a change when the next update happens.

This case is tested in round_trip_single_commit.sh
