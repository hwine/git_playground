For pre-existing git repos desiring releng/buildbot services, branches
need to be split to separate hg repositories (part of the contract to
get non-try buildbot services).

Also co-incident with the repo split is transitioning from a git RoR to
a set of hg RoR. For teams that really need a single git repo for their
workflow, recombining the master RoR will be explored.

These scenarios are tested in script files in this directory - you
should be able to run it on any machine wiht:
    - bash
    - git
    - hg
    - hggit extension

Scenario 1 - split git w/ 3 branches to 3 hg repos
--------------------------------------------------

demo script: split-git-to-hg.sh

The assumption is the 3 existing branches map to dev, stablilation (or
beta), and release:

                            +------>  hg-release
                            |
                            |
     git-ror ---------------+------>  hg-beta
                            |
                            |
                            +------>  hg-dev

Of course, this conversion must be incremental to minimize down time.
The scenario can be exercised via the split-git-to-hg.sh script. The
first execution will do the initial conversion. Subsequent runs will
simulate ongoing commits to the git-ror and incremental conversion to
hg.

Scenario 2 - recombine split git repos into one git repo
--------------------------------------------------------

demo script: not-done-yet

This may not be needed in practice, but it is of interest to know if it
can be done.
